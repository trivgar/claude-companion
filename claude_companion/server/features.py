"""The features the server loads, in nav order.

Each is a module in this package with `router` (a FastAPI APIRouter), and
optionally `TITLE` and `start(app)` for background work. A module that is not
there yet is skipped with a log line, so a branch without a feature still runs.
The page loads /static/<id>.js for each one that loaded.
