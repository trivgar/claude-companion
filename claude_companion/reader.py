    labelled, and the labelling needs a signal rather than a guess at the
    name shape: a real session could perfectly well be called `api-1`.

    that answer (spawned_by_session(), or bool(spawning_session())), and when
    it has one it decides. A job (job_of()) is a child whatever this says:
    the snapshot settles that before asking.

    `nameSource` WAS the signal, and it answers a different question: who
    chose the NAME. An SDK host drives Claude Code (`entrypoint: sdk-cli`)
    and passes no name, so its session is `agent-a6`, `nameSource: derived`
    -- and that host's agent, nobody's subagent, was labelled SUBAGENT. Its
    parent process is the host, not a session. The same would have caught a
    plain `claude` started with no --name.
