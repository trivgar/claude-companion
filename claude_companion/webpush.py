"""Notifications from the dashboard itself, under its own name.

Everything before this went out through somebody else's app, so Android labelled
it with theirs: "Termux:API", then "Home Assistant". The label is the app that
posted, and there is no field to override it -- the only way to carry the
dashboard's name is to be the app doing the posting.

The dashboard already is one. It ships a manifest and a service worker, and installs
to a phone's home screen; what it lacks is a secure origin, because Web Push
needs one and `http://myhost:8770` is not. `tailscale serve` fixes that with a
real Let's Encrypt certificate on the tailnet name.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, deliberately. The sender is the dashboard, so it can
report anything except its own death. Infrastructure alerts -- TTS down, Home
Assistant down -- stay on `phone-watch.sh`, which runs on a systemd timer
independent of this process and pushes through Home Assistant. Two senders, each
covering the blind spot of the other. That split matters: a notifier that cannot
report its own failure is how this morning's outage stayed invisible for
seventeen minutes.

Keys and subscriptions live beside the other caches in ~/.claude. A subscription
that answers 404 or 410 is gone for good and is dropped; anything else is the
push service having a bad minute and is kept.
