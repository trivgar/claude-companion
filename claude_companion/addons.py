"""Plug points: the `addons` setting names a module of yours, and the core
calls it at a few points. Every function here has a default for when there is
no module, and fails safe when the module raises. A plug-in can narrow what
the core allows, never widen it. `on_ask` receives created, decided, answered
and withdrawn events; a created result {"pushed": True} replaces the core
push, and {"answerable": False} sends the question back to the terminal."""
