# Drafts, never sends: the owner opens the draft and sends it themselves. The
# approving Claude run is allowed only ToolSearch and create_draft, and nothing
# else (agent_companion/mail/gmail.py). Idempotent: a reply that already has a
# draft id is skipped, and a lock keeps two passes from drafting the same reply.
