# Changes

What moved, and whether your settings need anything. Newest first.

## 2026-10-29
- Comms now uses the full `/api/tts/*` coordinator API and the voice lab has
  its five `/api/voicelab/*` routes. Set `tts_dir` to a coordinator directory
  when installing spoken comms. Without it, comms says that setup is needed
  and does not pretend clips were played.
- Optional settings: `tts_outbox_dir`, `voicelab_dir`, `tts_app_state`,
  `fcm_service_account_file`, and `android_apk_file`. Android push is off
  until the service-account setting names a readable file.
- Add-ons may provide `comms_busy() -> bool` to hold routine clips. The core
  default is never busy; an add-on cannot make an existing hold available.
- Mail has a per-account queue. `mail_queue_dir` optionally moves the queue.
  Set `mail_accounts` for every mailbox that may use it. An account chooses
  either the existing Claude Gmail connector or IMAP, for example
  `[mail_accounts.owner]` with `source = "gmail"`, and
  `[mail_accounts.other]` with `source = "imap"` and
  `credentials_file = "~/.config/claude-companion/other-gmail.json"`.
  The credential JSON contains its mailbox address and app password; keep it
  mode 600 and never put either value in `config.toml`. With no accounts, the
  Mail tab says it is not set up.
- An add-on's `person(request)` may return `mail_account` (or `id`) matching a
  `mail_accounts` key. That person can read and decide only that queue; the
  default remains the paired owner and the `owner` account. Approved entries
  create Gmail drafts only, and `gmail_draft_id` prevents a second draft on a
  later pass.
- Ring and live call are now wired. A pending ask can ring an authenticated
  Android app through FCM, with Web Push alerts as the fallback; answered rings
  open the owner-only live call. The call keeps no audio or words, only timing,
  contacted session names, and ring decision outcomes.
- New optional live-call settings: `gemini_key_file` (a file path, never the
  key in config), `livecall_daily_minutes` (default 120), `livecall_model`,
  `livecall_operator_name`, `livecall_voice`, and `livecall_log_file`.
  `private_projects` and the `addons.private` plug point keep projects out of
  Gemini; `addons.asleep` holds ringing while you sleep.
- To ring an Android app, install `claude-companion[fcm]` and set
  `fcm_service_account_file` to its Firebase service-account JSON path. The
  app registers its rotating device token at `/api/tts/app`, which requires
  the owner key, JSON, and the dashboard origin; `fcm_device_file` optionally
  changes where that token is kept. FCM receives only a ring id, never ask
  text or audio.
- Chat now uses the full direct-line API at `/api/cave/*`: per-session
  transcript windows, asks, suggestions, attachments, delivered files, seen
  state, activity and repository changes. The former `/api/chat/*` addresses
  remain as compatibility aliases.
- New optional settings: `chat_host` (the default session, empty by default),
  `chat_models` and `chat_efforts` (picker choices, both empty by default),
  `chat_resume_text`, `chat_seen_file`, and `chat_uploads_dir`.
- Add-ons may narrow direct-chat targets with `chat_target(target)`, supply
  optional character choices with `chat_characters(target)`, and handle
  installation-specific direct-chat actions with `chat_action(action, target,
  body)`. Without an add-on, no extra characters or actions are available.
- An ask whose input is too long to show whole (over 20 KB) can be denied
  here but only allowed in the terminal.
- `on_ask` add-ons receive `created`, `decided`, `answered` and `withdrawn`
  events. For `created`, `{ "pushed": true }` replaces the core push and
  `{ "answerable": false }` sends the question back to the terminal.
- New optional settings: `addons` (a module of yours with `person`, `on_ask`,
  `asleep`, `private`; all optional) and `private_projects`. Nothing to do if
  you use neither.
- Every route now declares who may use it; a test fails on one that does not.
- INSTALL.md section 14: an optional Chrome agent, with the rules and the guard it needs to run without prompts.
- `app_name` names the dashboard, the pairing page and the home-screen app
  (default "Companion").
- The ring's logic (`claude_companion.ring`): an ask unanswered 30 minutes while
  you are awake alerts once. Optional settings `ring_after_min`, `ring_gap_min`,
  `ring_day_max`; sleep and privacy come from `addons`. Not wired to a phone yet.
- The Android app (`mobile/`): a shell around the same page that adds
  background comms and ringing. Set `app_name`, `url` and `firebase_app_file`,
  run `python3 mobile/configure.py`, build and sideload (INSTALL.md, "Your
  phone"). Every name the phone sees comes from `app_name`. Nothing uses it
  until the ring and comms are wired to it.
