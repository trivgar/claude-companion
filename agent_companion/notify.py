"""Speak up when a session needs permission.

Claude Code fires a PermissionRequest hook when a tool call needs approval. This
turns that into one spoken line in that session's own voice, so a blocked
session announces itself instead of sitting there looking idle.

Runs inside a hook with a 2s timeout, so every path here is fast, silent on
failure, and side-effect free. TTS is OPTIONAL: with no configured coordinator
or bundled Comms script, the hook exits 0 having done nothing.
