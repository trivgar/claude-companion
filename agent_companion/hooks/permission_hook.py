"""Claude Code hook that asks the owner on the dashboard, not in the terminal.

Installed twice by `python -m agent_companion.server.install_hooks`: as the
PermissionRequest hook (every permission prompt) and as the PreToolUse hook on
AskUserQuestion (an agent's multiple-choice question). Each posts the ask to
the dashboard, which pushes a notification and shows it in the Asks tab, and
waits for the answer. Allow or deny goes back to Claude Code as the decision; a
question's picks go back as the tool's own `answers`. It never decides.

It waits as long as the ask is open. The prompt also shows in the session's own
window the whole time (Claude Code's status reads "waiting" while this runs),
so it is answered in whichever place comes first. Answered there, this ends:
No and Esc end it with SIGTERM, and Yes is seen in the session's status,
stamped after this began. When the dashboard goes quiet for QUIET_S or WAIT_S
runs out, the ask leaves the screen and the session, still at its prompt, is
marked waiting again.

Fast and quiet on any failure: it exits 0 and the session's own dialog shows.
