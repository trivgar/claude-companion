"""Gmail through `claude -p` and the claude.ai Gmail connector.

The connector is account-side, not in local config, so only a Claude session
has it. Each call below is a headless run whose --allowedTools names exactly
the tools it needs:

    listing and reading, and the voice guide:  Gmail read tools only
    creating a draft:                          create_draft only (and ToolSearch to load it)

There is no send, reply or forward tool in either list, so those are absent
from the session rather than merely discouraged by a prompt. The Gmail tools
are deferred in a headless session, so ToolSearch is allowed: it only hands
over schemas and calls nothing.
